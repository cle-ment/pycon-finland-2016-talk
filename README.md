# pycon-finland-2016-talk

Slides of my talk "Representation Learning and Deep Sequential Modeling for Predicting Topics of Sentences in Job Advertisements" at [Pycon Finland 2016](http://fi.pycon.org/2016/#talks-representation-learning). This talk was based on my master's thesis which can be found here <https://github.com/cle-ment/ma-thesis-tex>. A video recording of this talk is on YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA9KTQS_rV8>.

The slides are done in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) using the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) by [damianavila](https://github.com/damianavila).

The labelled dataset "sentences_aggregated_50-449.csv" to train the models is not included as I had a agreed with the company that I would not publish it but I could share it on request. Thus if you want to run the examples that need the data just send me a message.
